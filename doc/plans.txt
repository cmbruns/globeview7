* Principles:
  * Smooth: "everything" has continuous first derivatvies
  * Sparse: small numbers of "rich" locations can accurately reconstruct stuff
  * Accurate: explicitly track fidelity measured in real world units

as opposed to:
  * Jagged: overly simple primitives like line segments and triangles
  * Dense: so many primitives needed to get even basic accuracy
  * Good enough: If it's not obviously wrong, it's probably OK.
