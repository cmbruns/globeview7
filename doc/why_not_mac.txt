Mac issues:

The maximum OpenGL version is 4.1
  * My tessellation shaders fail to validate when passing vec3s between stages
    while using OpenGL 4.3 or earlier.

Tessellation shaders fail to validate on Mac, even when not passing vec3s.

The outline of the equirectangular projection does not show up on Mac.
  This might have to do with the infinite points involved.

Coastline rendering is very slow. Maybe too many vertices at once.

Display projection combo box does not take keyboard focus.

Mac full screen is not interacting well with the full screen toggle.
